# ContribCard

**ContribCard** is a tool that generates cards for your projects contributors. You can see a live demo [here](https://contribcard.clotributor.dev).

At the moment some parts (i.e. UI) are mostly focused on Kubernetes (to celebrate the Kubernetes 10th anniversary!), but we have plans to make it configurable so that the tool can be easily used by other projects. As soon as this is ready we'll provide some more documentation to explain how the tool works and how to install and use it.

> [!WARNING]
> ContribCard is at an early stage of development. There may be breaking changes in the future to the command usage, flags, and configuration file formats.
