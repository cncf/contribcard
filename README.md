# Contribcard

**Contribcard** is a tool that generates cards for your project's contributors. You can see a live demo [here](https://contribcard.clotributor.dev).

At the moment some parts (i.e. UI) are mostly focused on Kubernetes, but we have plans to make it configurable so that it can be used by other projects.

> [!WARNING]
> Contribcard is at an early stage of development. There may be breaking changes in the future to the command usage, flags, and configuration file formats.
